Alright so here's the idea

Conform is a simple game consisting of a grid of red squares. Click a square and it'll turn green, and so will nearby
squares - but the effect diminishes as it radiates outward, so the adjacent squares only turn 80% green, the second next 
adjacent 60%, etc. % numbers subject to change.
Each time you click, each square is influenced by it's neighbors, so the green-ness fades quickly for the more distant
squares, and even the clicked ones fade unless promptly surrounded by other clicked ones.
It might turn out it's just impossible to change all squares to green, or it might turn out to be inevitable. Figuring out
balanced % numbers might not be possible. We'll see.

pseudo-code:

x,y from input
green = GREEN_AFTER_CLICKED
loops = GREEN_AFTER_CLICKED/GREEN_DECAY_FROM_DISTANCE

for i = 0 to loops
{
	for j = 0 to i
	{
		square = squares.get(x-i,y-i+j) //from upper left, downwards
		if square != null
			square.setColor(255-green, green, 0) //assuming color is 0-255
		square = squares.get(x-i+j,y-i) //from upper left, rightwards
		if square != null
			square.setColor(255-green, green, 0)
		square = squares.get(x+i,y+i-j) //from lower right, upwards
		if square != null
			square.setColor(255-green, green, 0)
		square = squares.get(x+i-j,y+i) //from lower right, leftwards
		if square != null
			square.setColor(255-green, green, 0)
	}		
	green = green - GREEN_DECAY_FROM_DISTANCE
}

We'll need a class for the individual squares to easily handle setting colors, 
and one for the grid to easily handle out of bounds squares.  
Let's start with the squares to get straight to some way to display colored squares that can react to clicks.

Then we need to implement the eponymous conforming: how each square changes color according to its neighbors.
Before setting colors by clicking:

for i=0 to GRID_WIDTH*GRID_HEIGHT
{
	//get average colors of surrounding squares
	sum=0
	neighbors=0
	xPos = i%GRID_WIDTH
	yPos = floor(i/GRID_HEIGHT)
	currentSquare = squares.get(xPos,yPos)
	for x=xPos-1 to xPos+1
	{
		for y=yPos-1 to yPos+1
		{
			square = squares.get(x,y)
			if square != null && square != currentSquare
			{
				sum += square.getGreen()
				neighbors++
			}
		}
	}
	average = sum/neighbors
	currentSquare.setColor(255-average,average,0)
}
